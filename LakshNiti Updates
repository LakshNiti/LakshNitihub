  <h2>🏦 RBI Monetary Policy Update – August 6, 2025</h2>
  <p><strong>Repo Rate:</strong> Held steady at <strong>5.50%</strong><br>
     <strong>Policy Stance:</strong> Neutral (unanimous vote by MPC)</p>
  <p><strong>Inflation Outlook:</strong> CPI inflation projected at <strong>3.1%</strong> for FY26, revised from 3.7%. Core inflation steady at ~4.4% (~77-month low headline at 2.1% in June).</p>
  <p><strong>Growth Forecast:</strong> Real GDP growth maintained at <strong>6.5% for FY26</strong>; quarterly growth: Q1–6.5%, Q2–6.7%, Q3–6.6%, Q4–6.3%.</p>
  <p><strong>Liquidity Highlights:</strong> CRR remains at 3%; SDF rate at 5.25%; MSF & Bank rate at 5.75%. Liquidity surplus ~₹3 lakh crore daily; RBI to continue VRRR auctions to manage overnight rates.</p>
  <p><strong>Key Drivers:</strong>  
     – Low inflation allows room for further easing later this year.<br>
     – US tariff developments remain key risk—but impact uncertain.<br>
     – RBI continues to monitor credit transmission and growth-inflation dynamics.</p>
  <p><em>💡 Implication for borrowers: No immediate EMI relief. Sectors like real estate, autos, and consumer durable may remain under pressure as rate-sensitive areas. Markets interpret this as a cautious pause.</em></p>

  <h2>🌐 Trump’s Tariff Threats & India: Economic & Policy Reactions</h2>
  <p><strong>Tariff Increase:</strong> U.S. has imposed a <strong>25% duty</strong> on Indian exports effective Aug 1; further hikes expected within “next 24 hours” over India’s Russian oil imports.</p>
  <p><strong>Trump's Remarks:</strong> India accused of reselling Russian oil for profit. He called India a “dead economy” and warned tariffs could rise above 25% if the situation continues. Reuters reported the U.S. may raise retaliatory duties sharply.</p>
  <p><strong>MEA Response:</strong> India rejected the criticism as “unjustified and unreasonable”, citing hypocrisy by Western nations trading with Russia. India noted its oil procurement was strategic and necessary. :contentReference</p>
  <p><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Goldman Sachs has revised India’s GDP growth forecast downward (6.5% for FY26) citing trade tensions. Analysts warn the tariffs may shave up to US $18B off exports and raise inflation. Reuters estimates a 0.4% GDP drag; rupee weakened. :contentReference</p>
  <p><strong>RBI Governor’s Comment (Conf. Call):</strong> Sanjay Malhotra said it's “really very difficult” to quantify the tariffs’ impact precisely. RBI is maintaining repo rate at 5.5% and stuck with a 6.5% GDP forecast for FY26. :contentReference</p>
  <p><strong>Geopolitical Fallout:</strong> U.S.–India relations have cooled sharply despite earlier warmth at the Modi‑Trump summit. India is accelerating ties with Europe and ASEAN as diversification strategy amid tensions. :contentReference</p>
  <p><em>💡 Key takeaway: Strong U.S. pressure on India, triggered by its Russian oil ties, is now a critical headwind—impacting trade, markets, and policy flow. India stands firm on strategic autonomy while accelerating diversification of exports and diplomatic outreach.</em></p>

  <h2>🌐 Trump Tariffs on India – Economic & Policy Impact (August 2025)</h2>

  <p><strong>📢 Trump’s Announcement:</strong><br>
  On July 31, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a <strong>25% tariff</strong> on Indian exports like pharma, gems, and auto parts. He accused India of “reselling Russian oil for profit” and warned of a “very substantial hike” in tariffs within 24 hours if India doesn't reduce Russian imports.</p>

  <p><strong>🛑 India’s Response (MEA):</strong><br>
  India called Trump’s accusations “unjustified and unreasonable,” defending its oil trade as essential for energy security. The MEA emphasized that many Western countries continue trade with Russia and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy.</p>

  <p><strong>🤝 Trade Deal Breakdown:</strong><br>
  A proposed India–U.S. trade deal collapsed after failed talks over agricultural and defense sector access. Trump walked away, citing India's tariff regime and lack of reciprocity. India is now shifting focus to Europe and ASEAN trade alliances.</p>

  <p><strong>📉 Economic Forecast Impact:</strong><br>
  Goldman Sachs and Reuters estimate a <strong>GDP impact of –0.4%</strong> if tariffs are extended. India could lose $18 billion in export revenue. Rupee weakened slightly, and markets remain cautious.</p>

  <p><strong>🏦 RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra’s Statement:</strong><br>
  During the August 6 RBI policy meeting, the governor said:<br>
  <em>“It is really very difficult to quantify the tariff impact at this point… we have kept the repo rate unchanged at 5.5% as our GDP growth forecast of 6.5% still holds. But we are closely watching global developments.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>💡 Takeaway:</strong><br>
  Trump’s aggressive stance on trade could damage India’s exports and global partnerships. The government stands firm on oil policy, and the RBI is watching the situation cautiously without overreacting.</p>
